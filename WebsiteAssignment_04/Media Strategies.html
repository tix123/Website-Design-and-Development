<h1>3. Media Strategies</h1>

Media strategies are the methods in which to engage with a group of people through some form of media, for example, ads on Facebook to get them to reach the desired outcome, for example buying your electric car. Sometimes the expected outcome of your campaign may not be simply inspiring the customer to buy a product but to raise brand awareness or getting the customer interested in your product, so they investigate it more. Certain other ad campaigns may keep one’s company away from controversy or making it so that more people have a favorable view of your company, by for example detailing the fact that your vehicles are very environmentally friendlily. It is good for your advertisement to have a call to action as it will inspire people to make the decision you want and it can help clear up any misunderstanding with the customer about what you want them to do.

<h2>3.1. Conversion rate</h2>
The number of viewers of an ad actually ends up taking the desired action. Having a figure for the conversion rate is very important for determining the effectiveness of an advertisement. By finding methods that have better conversion rate we can get a better “bang for our buck”, this is especially important for small companies as they are less well known than big retailers and thus are very dependent on finding new customers, and they also have very small marketing budgets thus cannot continue burning money on an ineffective marketing campaign. To see the conversion rate from different types of traffic sources refer to figure 2.

<h2>3.2. Picking a Target for your campaign</h2>
It is important to know not only what your objective is but who your targets are . For example, if you sell a physical one-time purchase product your business model is dependent on you constantly getting new customers (such as Tesla or computer company). Furthermore, if you are a subscription-based company (such as Netflix or Adobe) it would just as valuable if not more so, then to keep existing customers as opposed to finding new ones. For the former advertising, the quality and longevity of your product may be important, while in the latter it would be more important to advertise how well maintained and updated your service is and how it would be worth paying a nominal monthly fee rather than buying a product outright.

<h2>3.3. Learn from mistakes or successes</h2>
Simply doing better is not the objective of media strategies we also have to learn from these successes or mistakes as to improve, change or refine your strategies in the future. For example if you expected a 10% increase in sales due to a new ad  campaign and you ended up will a 50% increase in sales you have to ask yourself questions like, why did this happen, was this do to your ad campaign or simply coincidence, is it this gain scalable if you invested more into similar ads would you see a greater increase,  and if the ad campaign is targeting a very niche audience has that new revenue stream been completely exploited. These are questions you would have to ask even if you saw a decrease in sales or a lower increase then what was expected but the main premise is that you need to learn imported lessons from your successes and your failure or you simply will fail to consistently improve. To see the processes, you should be using refer to figure 3.

<h2>3.4. Quantifying your objectives</h2>
<p>
We have to correctly Quantify our objectives as something that is aa real obtainable goal. For example, instead of thinking, we need to make more money think in terms we need to increase the amount of Tesla Model 3 we sell by at least 10% by the next quarter as compared to the current quarter. It this example we pointed to a specific product we want to grow by a specific amount, thus it would not make sense for us to advertise Tesla Model S in a campaign to get more people to buy the Tesla Model 3.
</p>
<p>
We will pick a social media strategy like targeting the environmentally concise and those with a high budget to help Tesla become the largest electric car seller in Canada in one year’s time. We will this via an ad campaign with a high conversion rate like e-mail or native advertisement to improve the public perception of electric cars and by extension Tesla.

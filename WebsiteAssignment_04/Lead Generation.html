<h1>2. Lead Generation</h1>

First of all, we would like to explain what is the definition of a lead generation in simple words. Lead generation is the process of attracting and converting strangers and prospects into someone who has indicated interest in your company’s product or service. Some examples of lead generators are job applications, blog posts, coupons, live events, and online content.

<h2>2.1. Lead generation process</h2>

<p>Firstly, as you can see from the above figure 1, we should attract strangers to become our customers through good marketing as channels, websites or social media.
Secondly, the visitors then will click in your images, buttons or messages and that will encourage the visitors to take some actions.
Then, that action will take your visitors to a landing page, which is a web page that is designed to capture lead information in exchange for an offer. 
Lastly, your visitors will fill out a form or accept your offer. At this point, the strangers will become a customer.</p>

<h2>2.2. Lead generation strategies to grow your online business</h2>

<h3>2.2.1. Fresh content </h3>
It is extremely significant to keep your products fresh and up to date. For instance, people are really curious about the range of Tesla batteries, so you should advertise that online to cover the curiosity of the customers.

<h3>2.2.2. Social media</h3>
Social media now a day is one of the most important ways to show your new product to strangers and attract them to visit your web site or even to come to your showrooms to see the new Tesla. Additionally, at this time there are many ways to advertise your new products, and the best ways to show people that are Facebook or YouTube channel. 

<h3>2.2.3. E-mail lists</h3>
Gathering email addresses can be one of the best ways to generate sales leads. The potential customer has offered their address in order to receive more information about your product or service. You now have the opportunity to turn a sales lead into a customer. E-mail is the most commonly used form of online lead generation, so it must be working. 

<h3>2.2.4. Online advertising </h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Pay per click ads, placed at the top of search engine results, pay-per-click (PPC) ads are a great way to get noticed. They are highly targeted to the keywords you select, so PPC ads are often extremely effective at generating high-quality leads. To help your ads stand out from the crowd, be sure to use clear and engaging language and have a compelling offer. </li>

<li>Display ads, more visual than their text-based PPC counterparts, display ads are also highly effective at lead generation because of their targeting abilities. Display ads can be placed on selected websites and come in a wide variety of formats including static images, GIFs, videos, wallpapers, popups and more. So, we recommend advertising new models of Tesla or new features was added to new of one of your Tesla. </li>

<li>Social media ads, to stay competitive on social media, many businesses today complement their organic social media efforts with paid initiatives. Advertising options vary by social platform but can encompass everything from static images to auto-play videos. These ads can appear directly in the user’s feed or on the side of the page. With social ads, beware of too much repetition. People typically spend lots of time on social media every day, so you want to be sure to switch your ad content frequently to avoid message fatigue.</li>
</ul>

As we have been working in this industry for several years. We can tell that the most important lead generation is social media because most people spend so much time on it or they stay online to see what is new. Furthermore, social media will increase your customers as they become comfortable with your new products. In addition, from our experience in this field, we see that people tend to know and buy new products. So, that will help your Tesla company to become one of the best sealers in the market especially because Tesla has zero-emission and people care about the environment nowadays.

<h1>5. Web Site Enhancements</h1>

Website enhancement is a user-interface feature that speeds up or enriches the interaction on some platforms for some users. We offer 10 ways to enhance the Tesla website.

<h2>5.1 Make Search Easy and Reliable</h2>
The first thing you should focus on is your search. The most common reason why people leave eCommerce sites without making purchases because they can’t find what they are looking for. Make sure your search bar is visible on the site and that suggestions are provided as visitors type their queries. 

<h2>5.2 Build a Large Encrypted Fence</h2>
Security is the biggest concern when people shop online since they can’t see the actual products. Therefore, make sure you satisfy them through proper refund and return policies and by using security verification programs.  You should highlight these on your website so that people won’t have to look hard to find them. Highly recommend using an accent or contrasting color. For example, if your site is predominately blue or light blue, find a nice yellow or a warm orange that accents your color palette, while calling attention to itself. 

<h2>5.3 The Power of Images</h2>
A lot of eCommerce websites allow people to zoom in photos using a small quadrant. If yours has this feature, it’s time to change it with something more responsive. For example, you can design your site to show an enlarged version of the image in another tab or a pop-up screen. 

<h2>5.4. Clearly State Your Price</h2>
Be very clear about the prices. Before a customer adds something to their cart, provide them with a very concise figure of what exactly they would be paying. If there are shipping charges or any other costs, consider providing a calculator at the right side of the page where they can calculate the final price before adding products to their carts.

<h2>5.5. Add Amazing Testimonials</h2>
People are more likely to make online purchases if there are testimonials to ensure that the retailer provides quality. If you have great clients that say great things about you, that’s amazing and it should be seen. If you use case studies or video testimonials, find a way to tuck them in there, or on product pages. To get these, you can ask your customers to provide a testimonial via email after the delivery is made.  (Refer to figure 7)

<h2>5.6. Streamline Your Checkout</h2>
Create a one-page checkout system to ensure that the deal can be closed in the shortest time. If customers are required to fill long forms spanning over several pages, they might get frustrated. Also, connection issues can create trouble between navigating pages. 

<h2>5.7. Instant Chat</h2>
<p>
Include an instant chat option to your site and have a sales representative get in touch with the visitor as soon as they arrive on your site. This way, if they are looking for something specific, they can find it with your help more conveniently while you get the chance to up-sell or cross-sell.
</p>
<p>
It’s a simple image that is on the bottom of the site (or with the scroll) just promoting people to chat with you. Live Chat, Bold Chat, Live Person & Kayako are some of the most popular Instant Live Chat services. 
</p>
<h2>5.8. Incentives Individuals to Register</h2>
Websites that require people to register before making a purchase see more unfinished deals than those which don’t ask. Most people are reluctant to register. However, the scenario can be turned around in your favor with the help of incentives. Offering a discount or reward to customers on their first purchase after registering can give them the right motivation to register at your site. 

<h2>5.9. Include Social Share and Follow Buttons</h2>
<p>
Producing great content and offers only go so far if you aren’t giving your users the opportunity to share what you have. If your website currently lacks social share buttons, you could be missing out on a lot of social media traffic that's generated from people already reading your blog!
</p>
<p>
If this sounds new to you, social sharing buttons are the small buttons that are around the top or bottom of blog posts. They contain icons of different social media websites and allow you to share the page directly on the social media channel of your choice. These buttons act as a non-pushy tool that encourages social sharing from your buyer personas. 
</p>
<h2>5.10. Mobile-friendly</h2>
Having a mobile-friendly site used to be a “should have,” now it’s a “must-have.”  If you don’t already know, 80% of internet users own a smartphone, and “Google says 61% of users are unlikely to return to a mobile site they had trouble accessing and 40% visit a competitor’s site instead”.  If you have a site that has tiny links and the site is hard to navigate, people are not going to want to stay on your site. You’ve done the pinch and zoom. It’s not very pleasant.  (Refer to figure 8)
